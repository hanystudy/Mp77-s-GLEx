Mp77-s-GLEx is an experimental platform based on OpenGL, all its code is from NEHE tutorials and Others' resources on Internet.
Notice that NEHE's tutorial is not adapt for mordern graphics programming, though they are almost running very well for even every OS today. I gived a few modification on these code so that some new style can be performed, But the programming base still came from NEHE, After all.

Since these code is based on Visual Studio 2010 and Qt 4.7.3, the including files above must be prepared before perform compling.
You may also need the newest visual studio add in from Qt official website:

For saving space, I didn't upload ./Data/ directory which concludes some terrain and texture data revised by me, they are nearly 80mb in total. If you need to these data files, please contact me 8621316@qq.com.
