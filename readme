Mp77-s-GLEx is a experimental platform based on OpenGL, all its code is from NEHE tutorial and Internet.
Notice that NEHE's tutorial is not adapt for mordern graphics programming, though they are running very well in most OS today. I gived a few modification on these code so that some new style can be performed, But the programming base still came from NEHE, After all.
